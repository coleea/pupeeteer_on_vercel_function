 
## VercelGL

VercelGL is a simple, lightweight API to use serverless chrome.
It is designed to be used with the [Vercel](https://vercel.com) platform, but can be used anywhere.

## Usage

currently there is only one route implemented

```
POST /api/screenshot
```

Body 

> Bear in mind that this app is more like template so fill free to bend for your use case (mine is looking for `<canvas>` the web)

```json
{
  "url": "https://bafybeigsw7gagsmvxxivt5kvrl6ueld7yszzef2aylxbzzafez6ybxscca.ipfs.nftstorage.link"
}
```

## FAQ

### This example does not work

Seems that many users have problem with paths etc.
Using **pnpm** as package manager seemed to make a difference.

### I am getting 504 HTTP error


Please increase `maxDuration` for the serverless functions in `vercel.json`:

```json
"functions": {
  "api/**/*": {
    "maxDuration": 60
  }
}
```
